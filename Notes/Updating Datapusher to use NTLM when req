# Updating Datapusher to use NTLM when required

Problem - Datapusher wants to read a file from iPlant and load it into the CKAN database
url is https://iplant.plantandfood.co.nz/etc 

in this case we want to add NTLM negotiation and headers to the get request

This has to happen either in the code base, or in some proxy filter.

### in code

datapusher is 
origin	https://github.com/avowkind/datapusher.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/ckan/datapusher.git (fetch)


our copy is forked from ckan version with these changes
datapusher/jobs.py
    ckan_url = 'http://ckan:5000' # AVW OVerride data['ckan_url']
This change because http://datahub.plantandfood.co.nz is not visible from inside the docker container
and we want to use a local service connecti

Similarly when reading from an uploaded file using the local path
    if resource.get('url_type') == 'upload':
        # If this is an uploaded file to CKAN, authenticate the request,
        # otherwise we won't get file from private resources
        headers['Authorization'] = api_key
        # AVW Hack replace domain with local ckan:5000
        url_lst = list(urlparse.urlparse(url))
        url_lst[1] = 'ckan:5000'
        url = urlparse.urlunparse(url_lst)

This means we will need to update datapusher from the upstream repo from time to time.

The forked version is incorporated into the docker-ckan build via the datapusher dockerfile
which lists the source repo
# ENV GIT_URL https://github.com/ckan/datapusher.git
ENV GIT_URL https://github.com/avowkind/datapusher.git

- We will want to add changes to enable NTLM authn if the url is plantandfood.co.nz

updating thus requires the rebuilding of docker_ckan. and as this won't have changed we need to 
force download of the datapusher repo.

* We also need a way to inject the username/password
